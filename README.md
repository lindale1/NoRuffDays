No Ruff Days is a full-stack web application that implements authentication and authorization built using React, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB in order to allow UGA students to track their tasks and remain on top of deadlines. Users have the ability to sign up and log in to their account where they can add tasks to a to-do list, edit and delete their tasks in their to-do list, mark their tasks as completed, and view their completed tasks. API data is fetched by displaying the live date and time.
